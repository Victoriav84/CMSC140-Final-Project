# Final-Project-Draft
My final project for CMSC140 is a hangman game. Python will randomly choose a word from a list, and the user will have 6 wrong tries to guess which letter is in the word. Running the code is the same as running any other code. As for guessing the letters and the word, just put them as lowercase and press enter.
